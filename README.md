# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project explores the global COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available datasets. It focuses on data cleaning, trend analysis, visualization, and deriving meaningful insights such as infection trends, vaccination progress, death rates, and recovery statistics.

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Import dataset using Pandas (`read_csv`)
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Format dates and numeric columns
   - Remove irrelevant rows (e.g., aggregate data like "World" if needed)
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Check top affected countries
   - Compare death rates vs population
   - Track growth curve over time
4. **Visualization**
   - Line charts for case trends
   - Bar charts for top affected countries
   - Heatmaps or maps (optional)
5. **Insights & Interpretation**
   - Peak months of infection
   - Effectiveness of vaccination campaigns
   - Country-wise comparison

##‚úÖ Key Findings (Examples - Replace with Actual Results)

- India and the USA had the highest number of daily spikes.

- Countries with higher vaccination rates saw a decline in deaths after mid-2021.

- Some low-income countries faced underreporting and data gaps.
